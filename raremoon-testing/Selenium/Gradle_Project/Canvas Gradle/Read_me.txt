##Selenium Automation code:

Java version should be 1.8 IDE : Eclipse IDE (Neon Version) Selenium version along with Jars : 2.35.1 Browser : We need to use relevant driver.exe files (for example : browsername.exe) for Chrome and IE Browers

Excel Sheet : I have hardcoded some values in Excel like UserName and Password. I have calling the same excel file in Login and Dashboard files. Jars required for Excel : jxl.jar

I have seperated the code based on each screen(Brower, Login, Dashboard, ChatClass, Logout) we are calling each functionality from main class.
